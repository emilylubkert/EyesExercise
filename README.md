# Eyes Exercise

## Description
This project displays 2 eyes, whose pupils move to follow the mouse. An image also moves to follow the mouse. At first, the image is a question mark: what do the eyes need? Users can click a button to change the image and provide what the eyes need.

## How to Run
Images will load upon loading the [webpage](https://emilylubkert.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/). Clicking the button changes the image.

## Roadmap of future improvements 
- Choose a need from a drop-down menu to change image
- Add more detail to face
- Add text pop-ups to show 

## License information 
This project was created as an assignment as part of MIT xPro's Professional Certificate in Coding, a full stack development program.
